        </h3>
        <h4>
          The Nov./Dec. 2010 edition of The OZARKS MOUNTAINEER magazine has a very interesting article titled "Clever's Vanishing Railroad Depot" I purchased the magazine at Borders Book Store for $3.95 plus tax. The following is quoted from page 30: " In 1972, Clever's Mayor Howard Little saved the depot from the wrecking ball by moving the building to his farm. Mayor Little built a barn around it to preserve it for future generations. The building was soon forgotten and there it has remained, hidden from the world, for over three decades." The two page article goes on to mention the current owners are contacting the Missouri Pacific Historical Society in hopes of preserving and renovating the historical building. Joe G.
